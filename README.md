## 🎯 What is SPX?

SPX (Scheme Proxy) is a free tool that solves a common frustration: **broken custom scheme links**. Ever tried to share a `slack://`, `zoom://`, or `obsidian://` link in Notion and it just won't work? SPX fixes that.

## ✨ Why Use SPX?

- 🔗 **Universal Compatibility** - Share links that work in Notion, Obsidian, email, and any platform
- ⚡ **Instant Conversion** - No signup required, get your link in seconds
- 🔒 **Privacy First** - We don't store your URLs, everything happens in your browser
- 🎨 **Beautiful & Simple** - Clean, modern interface that just works
- 📱 **Mobile Friendly** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Paste** your custom scheme link (e.g., `slack://channel/ABC123`)
2. **Toggle** auto-open if you want automatic redirection
3. **Copy** your universal link and share it anywhere!

**Before:** `slack://channel/ABC123` ❌ (broken in Notion)
**After:** `shortlink.studio/1/slack://channel/ABC123` ✅ (works everywhere!)

## 💡 Perfect For

> _**spx** - **s**cheme **p**ro**x**y_

A simple tool that allows naive proxying of urls with custom schemes.
Useful for cases when you don't have an ability to use original url, because of some limitations (ex. urls on [**Notion**](https://notion.so/product))

### Usage

The tool is quite simple to use:

1. Open page: [spx.now.sh](https://spx.now.sh)
2. Provide url with custom scheme (ex. `steam://run/855860`)
3. Choose automatic (open by default), or manual mode (visitor would need to click link in the browser)
4. Press "Copy" - a generated url will be copied to the Clipboard.
